## About Me
I want to do what I love in an interesting and promising company.
I have a higher technical education, interned at EPAM, also graduated from their internal laboratory FRONT-END LAB SUMMER-FALL 2021. I am familiar with SQL and React at a basic level. I took a course from SpurIT, where I worked with Shopify.
I work responsibly and learn quickly.
## Code example
"Unique In Order" from CODEWARS: Implement the function unique_in_order which takes as argument a sequence and returns a list of items without any elements with the same value next to each other and preserving the original order of elements.

For example:
```
uniqueInOrder('AAAABBBCCDAABBB') == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B']
uniqueInOrder('ABBCcAD')         == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'c', 'A', 'D']
uniqueInOrder([1,2,2,3,3])       == [1,2,3]
```
Solution
```
var uniqueInOrder=function(iterable){
  const result = [];
  
  for(let i = 0; i < iterable.length; i++){
    if(iterable[i] !== iterable[i + 1]){
      result.push(iterable[i]);
    }
  }
  
  return result;
}
```
